# Self-Compassion and individual differences in risk and vulnerability factors in Rescue Workers

Version: 2023, September 27

## Purpose

This study is designed to examine the relationship between individual differences in the protective and risk factors among rescue workers and their inclination to rely on self-compassion as a coping mechanism. Specifically, the study seeks to

1. identify distinct individual differences "profiles" based on combinations of protective and risk factors and examine their respective associations with varying levels of self-compassion, and
2. determine which facets of self-compassion are predominantly linked to maladaptive resilience profiles in rescue workers.
